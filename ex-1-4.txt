Our model of evaluation requires the evaluation of subexpressions and then the application of the operator to the operands. In this instance, the operator is a compound expression. It's subexpressions will be evaluated. The subexpression that is the conditional expression will evaluate to an operator that is "+" or "-". This operator will then be applied to the operands that are "a" and "b".
