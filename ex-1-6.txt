"if" is a special form. That means it has its own rule of evaluation. The predicate is evaluated first. If it resolves to true, only the consequent expression is evaluated and returned. The alternate expression is never evaluated. If the predicate resolves to false, only the alternate expression is evaluated.

Alyssa's "new-if" procedure is not a special form. Therefore, it is subject to applicative order evaluation. This means that each subexpression will be evaluated. The "new-if" procedure(operator) will be applied to the evaluated arguments(operands). The arguments of the "new-if" procedure will all be evaluated. This is the key difference between "new-if" and special form "if". Since (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x) is the third argument, it will be evaluated. This recursive call creates an infinite loop. The "new-if" operator has not even been applied yet.
